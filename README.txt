These examples demonstrate some uses of objects in the timbreID library.  Most of them are simple proofs of concept that are provided with the hope that others will expand upon them for more specific needs.  If there's a feature you would like to see added to any of them, first try to realize it on your own!  The timbreID objects are designed to be flexible and have lots of options.  It's usually only a matter of patch design to add features to any specific application.  But if you're finding that a certain object lacks an option needed to realize your application, send me a message and I'll add it in the next timbreID update if possible.
