There are a few files in the ordering folder.  order-perc.pd & analyze-batch-perc.pd are both for ordering a set of percussion sounds. order-perc.pd contains a very basic ordering example to demonstrate functionality, though it has some sophisticated time-dependent analysis sub-patches to look at.

analyze-batch-perc.pd can be run in Pd's batch mode to analyze the sound set (a big time saver). Note that analyze-batch-perc.pd still uses the real time analysis objects (i.e., bfcc~ instead of bfcc).  This will be updated in the future since timbreID now includes non-real-time analysis objects. The other patch, order.pd, loads samples to RAM and analyzes by reading directly from tables.

Open order.pd and try analyzing cartoons.wav in the sound folder. The patch breaks the audio into grains (you specify the size in samples), then re-orders them based on similarity using BFCCs.
